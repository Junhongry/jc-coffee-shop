## Feature Ideas:

- Leading up to the event, the home page will be a count down timer/ rsvp 
- Need to design the home page
- Coffee menu with picture of drinks (pictures or drawn?)
- Menu: Cards with title and photo only? react card style
- Explanation of each drink when clicked. Maybe expanded card? 

Stretch: 
- Ordering system built in 
- Build in silly coffee/matcha personality quiz with the cute characters  ( need someone to draw them)
-
